WoodBlocks with DLV AI Solver

Is this repo useful? No!
In fact, is another useless project for the AI Course.
Here was used DLV but can be better with Z3 Solver.
I will do it? I don't know, depend.

Ayway, this prj was possible thanks to my collaborator that help me a lot with the logic of the game because I suck with DLV...
Thank Jhoanny, you have my respect.
